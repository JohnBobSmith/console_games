    -a heck of a lot of changes ;).
    
---END EXAMPLE---

Changes for Thursday, December 31st:
  -Added a changelog file. It is now mandatory to keep track of my massive commits.
  
  Changes for Tic Tac Toe:
    -A much nicer way of adding pieces. The player now picks a number, 0 through 8, which corresponds
    with their move. Still a work in progress, but games are playable with the new "UI" if you will.
    
    -Severely reduced the ammount of code in main(). Further input optimizations.
    
    -added int Game::make_move(int input, char piece); This allows (hopefully) error-free placement of player pieces.
    
    -scrapped Player::parse_input() as it was impossible to get working. 
    
    -0 through 9 are all valid inputs, and my input validator now thinks so too.
    
    -Added basic CLI argument support. Number of players and prefered pieces are now done via these arguments. As an example,
    ./tictactoe 20 starts a two player game with random (0) pieces. More documentation to come as I flesh it (CLI args) out further.
    This drastically simplifies things and further optimizes the code in main().
    
    -Basically removed code for a single player game at this time. I have every intention of making a single player AI in the future.
