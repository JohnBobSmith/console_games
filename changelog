CHANGELOG FORMAT WILL BE: <date> <enter, tab> <subproject> <enter, tab> <hypehn> CHANGES
---FOR EXAMPLE---

  -Added the changelog
  
  tictactoe
    -a heck of a lot of changes ;).
    
---END EXAMPLE---

Changes for Thursday, December 31st:
  -Added a changelog file. It is now mandatory to keep track of my massive commits.
  
  Changes for Tic Tac Toe:
    -A much nicer way of adding pieces. The player now picks a number, 0 through 8, which corresponds
    with their move. Still a work in progress, but games are playable with the new "UI" if you will.
    
    -Severely reduced the ammount of code in main(). Further input optimizations.
    
    -added int Game::make_move(int input, char piece); This allows (hopefully) error-free placement of player pieces.
    
    -scrapped Player::parse_input() as it was impossible to get working. 
    
    -0 through 9 are all valid inputs, and my input validator now thinks so too.
    
    -Added basic CLI argument support. Number of players and prefered pieces are now done via these arguments. As an example,
    ./tictactoe 20 starts a two player game with random (0) pieces. More documentation to come as I flesh it (CLI args) out further.
    This drastically simplifies things and further optimizes the code in main().
    
    -Basically removed code for a single player game at this time. I have every intention of making a single player AI in the future.

Changes for Wednesday Janruary 6th 2016:
	Changes for Tic Tac Toe:
		-Picking up where I left off. Working on fixing bugs and ensuring proper stalemate checking.
		
		-Fixed bugs with CLI argument detection. Invalid arguments close the program.
		-Player piece assignment from CLI arguments is now more uniform, improving readability
		-Fixed the date in the changelog. Somehow entered 26th instead of 6th...
		-Fixed stalemate detection. Works as intended, until I break it again. Hopefully that wont happen ;)
		-Un-commented win checking. So that means players should now be able to play full games! :D
		
		-Further improved CLI arguments. Adding a new option, 4, which brings up help
		-Added a proper help menu! yay!
		-Language improvents. IE my std::cout messages have been improved across the board.
			-These improvements add uniformity, enhance readability, etc.
		-Added a new function in game.h/cpp to allow printing of a help board, showing piece locations.
			-This board is not affected by user input. It is display/read only.
		-Misc. cleanup, removal of duplicate messages, etc.
		-The overlap detected message is now in ALL CAPS to make it more noticeable.
			-Also added whitespace to it. Now the player cant miss it.
