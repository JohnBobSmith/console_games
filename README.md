IMPORTANT: NO LONGER WORKING ON THIS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. SORRY :(

# Console Games
Repo for storing all of my command line games, including Tic Tac Toe currently. This repository will contain "production" code if you will. Which is mostly some products (games) that I will probably maintain for some time. These projects will be written in C++, with the possibility of Lua not ruled out. Everything will be 110% free in every sense of the world. Which is why I use the MIT License. Enjoy!

This repository currently contains Tic Tac Toe in a heavy development (bug ridden but potentially playable) state. Futurue plans for games include working hangman (including ASCII art), a word chain game, really anything that is played with text and and/or a 2 dimensional board. Heck, even dice games like Yahtzee could work. Basically, whatever I feel like doing on a day-to-day basis. The idea for me is to do something productive instead of mindlessly blasting up scrubs in call of duty and counter strike. It has had some negative effects for me. I hate being bored though, so if I'm coding, I am acomplishing something and enjoying it.

For my projects I plan on developing some sort of basic AI to play against, in addition to human player(s). I have no intentions, at all, of doing networking. This is not a possibility unless you, someone interested in forking the project, want to do so yourself.

####IMPORTANT NOTE #1: - License
Every single project that is in this repository (console games) is to be assumed licensed under MIT, even if I dont explicitly have a LICENSE file in, say, console_games/tictactoe. Really it doesn't matter, but it kind of does, because absense of license means copyright applies, which it most defnitely should not. Assume the MIT License for everything in here please :). 

####IMPORTANT NOTE #2: - Bugs! Lots of them!
Assume that, for the time being, everything in here is under heavy development. I shall define heavy development as "the making of computer software that knowingly and/or unkowingly has errors and problems (bugs) associated with it, and the developers are actively working on fixing said errors." Basically, I make no guaruntees of anything, see the LICENSE file for the entire rant. Bugs are probably my fault, and if you want to help me fix them, feel free to do so! But if your PC explodes causing the nuclear apocalypse, well... thats not my fault. 

####IMPORTANT NOTE #3 - Technical info: I wont support Windows of any kind.
Chances are if you're smart enough to be on github looking at programming projects, you know that you also need a C++ compiler to run my games. I will not be distrubitng binaries, if they are in here, it's a mistake. I have an albeit ugly Makefile you may use for this (compiling) purpose. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING A WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM ON THE GROUNDS THAT I DO NOT OWN A WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, AND THEREFORE CAN'T POSSIBLY TEST, BUG FIX, OR COMPILE CORRECTLY FOR THAT PLATFORM. I WOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVIENENCE, BUT THEN I REMEBER THAT LINUX IS FREE. SO IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MY GAMES, FEEL FREE TO POKE AROUND FOR A LINUX DISTRIBUTION THAT SUITS YOUR NEEDS. I AM NOT AN ELITIST IN ANY WAY, I JUST DO NOT OWN A WINDOWS PC, AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO MAKE QUALITY SOFTWARE FOR THAT PLATFORM.

Thats about it. I really hope you enjoy my work!
